`
An system prompt is a predefined instruction or set of instructions provided to guide the behavior, style, or functionality of a language model during a conversation. This prompt sets the tone, context, and boundaries for how the AI should interact with the user.

Key Features of a System Prompt:

1. Behavior Definition:
It specifies the role the AI should take. For example: "You are an AI assistant." or "You are a helpful tutor for physics concepts."

2. Scope and Boundaries:
It defines what the AI can or cannot do. For instance: "Stick to verified information."

3. Context Initialization:
It provides context for the conversation, such as introducing a fictional scenario, setting up a task, or clarifying the AI's expertise.

4. User Experience Shaping:
It ensures the AIâ€™s responses align with the intended user experience, such as focusing on clarity, brevity, or detail.
