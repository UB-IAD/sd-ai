 *
 * The evaluation works by providing the LLM with expert knowledge about a domain, then checking 
 * whether the generated CLD includes specific variables, concepts, and causal relationships 
 * that experts have identified as important for representing the system. This allows us 
 * to assess whether the model captures the essential qualitative understanding that makes

            Public health experts recognize that pandemic response involves complex interactions between health outcomes, 
            policy measures, and socioeconomic factors. Disease transmission drives infection rates, which create pressure 
            for policy interventions like lockdowns and mask mandates. These interventions reduce transmission but also 
            cause economic hardship and mental health impacts. Economic stress can undermine compliance with health measures, 
            while prolonged restrictions lead to "pandemic fatigue" that reduces public cooperation. Healthcare system capacity 
            affects mortality rates, and when overwhelmed, drives more aggressive policy responses. Public trust in government 
            and health authorities influences compliance with measures. Political considerations balance health outcomes against 
            economic and social costs. Vaccination campaigns provide a path out of restrictions but face issues of supply, 
            distribution, and public acceptance.

            public compliance, healthcare capacity, political pressure, mental health, public trust, vaccination rollout.`,

            Mental health experts understand that mental health outcomes result from complex interactions between individual, 
            social, and systemic factors. Social isolation increases depression and anxiety, while mental health problems can 
            lead to further withdrawal from social connections. Economic stress from unemployment or financial hardship 
            contributes to mental health problems, which in turn can impair work performance and job stability. Access to 
            mental health services is limited by availability, cost, and stigma. Stigma prevents people from seeking help, 
            perpetuating untreated mental illness. Community support and family relationships provide protective factors, 
            but mental illness can strain these relationships. Substance abuse often co-occurs with mental health problems, 
            creating additional complications. Educational and workplace policies around mental health affect disclosure, 
            accommodation, and treatment access.
            
            Key variables that experts agree are essential: social isolation, economic stress, stigma, access to services,

            reducing the benefits realized from technology investments. Poor early results can undermine leadership support 
            and reduce future investment. However, successful early wins build momentum and confidence. Employee training 
            and change management programs can reduce resistance, but require time and resources. Organizational culture 
            affects receptivity to change - cultures that value innovation and learning adapt more easily. Communication 
            from leadership about the rationale and benefits of change influences employee buy-in. Legacy systems and
